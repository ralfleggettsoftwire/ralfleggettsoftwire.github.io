                                variety of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms in the field of search and
                                rescue. We developed a custom sandbox environment to model potential scenarios at a high
                                level and worked with RLlib -- a scalable deep reinforcement learning library -- to
                                trial a variety of disaster scenarios, using heterogeneous agent types with different
                                abilities. We concluded that there is potential for these algorithms to guide agents at
                                a high level on the tasks to carry out -- exploration, search, rescue or recovery -- but
                                that control at a micro level will still likely require human intervention at a minimum.

                                Warwick ABACUS (Association of British and Chinese University Students) is an inclusive
                                society that aims to bring together the often disparate British and Chinese university
                                communities through a variety of events that cater to a range of people.

                                <p>
                                I helped out the other officers with planning and running events, as well as with
                                seeking new sponsorships to grow our budget. The year ended with our most extravagant
                                event, the ABACUS ball, which took place in a country house hotel for dinner and drinks
                                with live performances, a dancefloor and a fireworks show to end the night

                                I managed the various CS:GO teams competing for Warwick in the two university leagues
                                and helped run events, including a tournament that saw teams from several European
                                universities with connections with Warwick compete over the course of a week.
                                </p>

                                Also assisted with finding
                                new sponsorships by writing a pitch to and meeting with HyperX, a leading brand for
                                gaming peripherals, that culminated in a partnership that was covered in several esports
                                publications and paved the way for the university to directly fund the society through a
                                Â£250,000 investment into an esports centre with permanent staff.

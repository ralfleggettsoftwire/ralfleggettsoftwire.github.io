                        Dropped into a high-pressure startup with a tight deadline to completely rework a major

                            Wrote and tuned several prompts to successfully take a Request For Proposal (RFP) document
                            and generate a response outline complete with citations to the original document and

                            Tackled context window limitations by devising logic to split long documents into several
                            LLM calls and stitch the responses together. This eliminated a major pain-point of the
                            product that prevented its use on many RFPs.

                    <p>
                        Led a team of 6 on a year-long investigation into multi-agent reinforcement learning
                        algorithms for search and rescue. We developed a custom sandbox environment to model scenarios
                        at a high level and worked with RLlib — a scalable deep reinforcement learning library — to
                        trial a variety of disaster scenarios, using heterogeneous agents with different abilities.
                        We concluded that there is potential for these algorithms to provide high-level guidance, but
                        that control at a micro level will still likely require human intervention at a minimum.

                            Warwick ABACUS (Association of British and Chinese University Students) is an inclusive

                            communities through a variety of events that cater to a range of people.

                        <p>
                            I helped the other officers plan and run events, and with seeking new sponsorships to grow
                            our budget. The year ended with the ABACUS ball at a scenic country house hotel with dinner,
                            drinks, live performances, a dance-floor and a fireworks show to end the night.
